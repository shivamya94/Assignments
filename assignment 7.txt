Iterative Control Statements (Part - 2)
1. Write a program to find the Nth term of the Fibonnaci series.
#include <stdio.h>

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
        return 0; // 
    }
    else if (n == 1) {
        return 0; // First Fibonacci term (0)
    }
    else if (n == 2) {
        return 1; // Second Fibonacci term (1)
    }

    int a = 0, b = 1, c;
    for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        c = a + b; 
        a = b;    
        b = c;
    }
    return c;
}

int main() {
    int n;

    printf("Enter the position (N) of the Fibonacci series: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    printf("The %dth term of the Fibonacci series is: %d\n", n, fibonacci(n));

    return 0;
}
