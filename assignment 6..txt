Use any loop

1. Write a program to calculate sum of first N natural numbers.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int N, sum = 0;

    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &N);

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        sum += i;
    }

    printf("The sum of the first %d natural numbers is: %d\n", N, sum);

    return 0;
}


2. Write a program to calculate sum of first N even natural numbers.
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int N, sum = 0;

    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &N);

    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        sum += 2 * i;  // Add the i-th even number (2, 4, 6, ...)
    }

    printf("The sum of the first %d even natural numbers is: %d\n", N, sum);

    return 0;
}
